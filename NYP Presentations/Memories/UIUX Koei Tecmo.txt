User interface meant to help progress the game through experience. 
what do you feel when youre playing a game?
do you feel lost when you look through the UI?
Laggy?

types of UI
    diegetic
        exist in game space and story
        ammo counter and health bar on models
    non-diegetic
        does not appear within the game space nor in the story, UI solely for players
        HP bar, mana bar
    meta
        exists in game story but does not in game space
        viewable, tells the player information, non interactable
        camera effects, blood splatter
    spatial
        does not exist in game story but exists in game space
        guiding arrows to tell the player information, item name, target highlighting

good UI is not talked about, but poor UI stands out

UI is meant to help the user to interact with the game without the user going through a weird process

UIUX for software/apps/webs VS for games
    Ease of use VS Immersion

visual perspective
    matching the world setting of the game
    easy to read and understand
    keeping the fourth wall secure
functional perspective
    establish overall play flow
    un-obstructive but accessible
    supports what the game is trying to do

contrast brings attention, makes the viewer focus on contrast before text
contrast and readibility come hand in hand
    gradient doesnt cover the text
        changing colors do not draw attention away from text
    text is not obstructed
        no decorations
        no distractions
    moving and animations also bring attention
    flat shapes and color
    variation
        curves
        not the same colors

placement of information
    keeping information well managed
    use size, color, common rules and alignment to ensure that required information is easily comprehended
        main information and interactables should be larger and placed in the middle
        supplementary items should be smaller and placed aside, as some people do not need/want to look at it.
    distractions
        people want to play their game, not look at information
        UI must not obstruct or distract from actual Gameplay
            always determine what is the most important information players need at a certain moment
        most UI during game time is at the edges
        color themes to allow the player to glance and understand
            health is red, mana is blue, keep consistant
        non-useful UI should disappear, fade out over time
        immediate data should be contrasting and more accessible

approaches to UIUX in games
    visual aspects
        does it look good
        easy to read and understand
        match the concept of your game
    functional aspects
        play flow smoothness
        does it obstruct view
        does it support the game

objects > layout > flow
    cohesive rules
    players knows what to expect
    understand, faster navigation
